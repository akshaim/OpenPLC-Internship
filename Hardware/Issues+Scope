Issues and Future Scope in the hardware design-

A. PCB design for baseboard-
1. Improper relay footprint- pads for coil are too small
2. Improper footprint for electrolytic tantalum capacitors for LDO- footprint is smaller and inappropriate.
3. Move the pi-zero breakout towards the relay by 10-20 mm
4. If you are using LDO to generate 3.3V DC voltage,do not provide it to pi-zero breakout as the pi-zero will be powered by 5V DC through the buck converter.

B. Architecture design for baseboard-
1. Make provision for 5V DC digital inputs interfacing.
2. Make provision for 12V DC output.
3. Make provision for Analog Ground.
4. Try to implement analog circuitry on the bottom baseboard itself.

C. PCB design for topboard-
1. Improper footprint for ground breakout- Use standard 2.54mm header strictly.
2. Improper footprint for analog breakout- Use standard 2.54mm header strictly.
3. Reduce the size of the topboard by 20-30mm.
4. Move the pi-zero breakout slightly towards relays by 10-20mm.

D. Future Scope-
1. Make the hardware compatible to the IEC Industrial Standards.
2. Make a topmost board having an ethernet ciruitry.
3. Make efficient power management.

*Please ensure that the buck output is set to strictly 5V DC voltage while using pi. In case of higher voltages,pi will get burnt up.
