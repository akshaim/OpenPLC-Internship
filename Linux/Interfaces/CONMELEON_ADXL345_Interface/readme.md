# Conmeleon ADXL345 Interface

This interface for ADXL345 was written based on an existing abstract class 'spidevice' provided by CONMELEON. The code was written such that
it could be compiled with Forte. Some basic applications were written on top of the interface to test it.

We did not compile the interface with Forte and hence it was not tested with Forte although separately the interface was tested. 

Any application should be compiled using the following command: 

	sudo g++ -std=c++11 -o targetFileName spidevice.cpp adxl345.cpp applicationFileName
